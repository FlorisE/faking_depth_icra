# faking_depth_icra
ICRA 2023 release of depth completion of transparent objects using augmented unpaired data

To install, clone this repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Probably best to run it in a conda, virtual or docker environment :)

Models that convert from RGBD to RGBD can be found in the folder `RGBD2RGBD`. Models that convert from depth to depth can be found in the folder `Depth2Depth`.

Some notebooks for evaluating the results are also included, but these notebooks are quite bare.
